# FarsiWikipediaCrawler
This Python code collects all the paragraphs from a Farsi Wikipedia page.
I will soon improve the "link_finder" function and add it to the body of the code, so it can gather suitable links from each page.
In addition, I need to add a loop so that the process of crawling happens on the links gathered as well.
